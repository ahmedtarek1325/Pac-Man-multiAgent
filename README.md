# Pac-Man-multiAgent
<a href= 'https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/project2/#introduction'>Pac-Man multi-agent</a> is the second project required by Berkely university in the AI course "CS 188". The project has five stages to fulfilled, covering different algorithms such as MinMax, ExpextiMax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning. The Pac-Man game was given fully implemented. We were required only to edit the "multiagent.py" file. Our role was to implement different agent functions to make the agent play and win the game by himself.
